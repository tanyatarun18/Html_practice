    headings.
Significance - 1. Meaningful , 2. readable -->

<!--Some of the semantic tags are - 
1. <header> - Header is basically the heading part of the website. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <footer>Good Luck !</footer>

    <!-- 4.<nav> - It is used to link something from another page. Like we created a list of fruits and then also want to give the details 
        about the fruit but not in that page so we provide the link of the page where the detail of that fruit is given.-->
    <nav>
        <a href = "Btech.html"></a>

    <!-- 5. <section> - It is grouping different related contents together like what div and span do. Its just semantic way.
         6. <article> - It is somewhat used to write some contents like articles.
         7. <aside> - It is used to link related indirect contents. Like we created a list of fruits and put a link of details about it
            through nav tag but also want to put recipes made through the fruit so we'll use asided tag and put a link of that recipe.-->

    </nav>
</body>
