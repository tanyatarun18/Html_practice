    <h1>Hello.....</h1><br>
    Like a scene in a movie or a verse in a song, paragraphs are the building blocks of any good piece of writing.<br>
    Paragraphs lend a natural rhythm to your writing that makes it a joy to read. <br>
    The question is, how do you handle them successfully?<br><hr>
    <!--hr tag is used to seperate the  page using a single line.-->
    
    Below, we take a close look at what makes up an effective paragraph and explain how to write one that suits your needs.<br>
    We also cover some advanced tips. But first, letâ€™s start with the fundamentals.<br> </p> 

    <!--br is used to break the line(or say to change to line). This tag does not have ending tag.--> 

    <center> Hello World ! </center>
    <!-- This tag is  used to place the content in center.-->

    <pre> print("Hello People !")</pre>
    <!-- This tag id used to write the content as it is written in the html tag.-->

    
    <!--Block vs Inline element
    Block Element are those which takes the full width even though it requires or not. Like heading or paragraph tag, although we write 
    only one word but it takes the whole line and start the next tag from next line.

    But inline Element like anchor tag(a href) takes only those where words are written. It doesn't take the whole line and doesn't start 
    from new line until we use break tag -->
